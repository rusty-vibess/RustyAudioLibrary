# Component Directory

Here we have the component directory.

`portaudio/`
Contains a distribution of PortAudio that will be used to build out the library when the build script is run.

`RustyAudioLibrary-v0.7`
Contains the source code for the RustyAudioLibrary before it is compiled into a static binary library to be used in the `project/` directory.
