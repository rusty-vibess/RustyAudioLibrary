# RustyAudioLibrary Source Code Directory

Here we have the RustyAudioLib ðŸš€ source code.

`RustyAudioLib/`
Contains everything needed to build RustyAudioLibrary, from all of it's includes to all of it src files.

The only thing missing is a PortAudio distribution, as that is created via the build process.

Please do not try to run the makefile in this directory outside of the `build` script.

It's also worth noting that if you want to look at source code you are probably better off looking at the `docs` (`docs.html`). 

My Doxygen build has been setup to put a link to the source code at the bottom of every page. Clicking on a file like `RustyAudioEngine.hpp` at the bottom of a page will then take you to the Doxygen presentation of the code which will have removed all of the excessive commenting needed to generate the docs.
