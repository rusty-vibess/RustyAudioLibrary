# RustyAudioLibrary
### Welcome

RustyAudioLib is a simple, easy-to-use C++ library for the purpose of audio manipulation and audio tool creation.

It comes pre-packaged with a build script and pre-generated Doxygen documentation.

## Building

First, open a terminal in the `RustyAudioLib-main` folder.

Once there, run the build script. This can be done by entering the below command:
```sh
sh ./build
```

Once complete, your project should be ready to go under a newly created directory `project/` --  ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Feel free to then open the `project/` directory in your code editor of choice.

`build` will also create a `docs.html` file which is opened automatically for you. Feel free to refer to these docs at any point.

## Resetting

If, for any reason, you wish to reset your RustyAudioLibrary build, run:
```cpp
sh ./reset
```
